## Troubleshooting

**Game won't start?**
- Make sure you have Godot 4.3 or higher
- Check that all files were downloaded properly

**Graphics look blurry?**
- This is expected - currently using placeholder colored rectangles
- The rendering is set to pixel-perfect mode in the project settings

**Can't find enemies?**
- They're the colored squares moving around in the rooms
- Red = Goblin, Orange = Skeleton, Purple = Knight

**Locked door won't open?**
- You need a key! Defeat more enemies until one drops a key
- Keys are shown in the HUD (top-left corner)
